# Task 02 – SOLID Principles and Design Patterns

## Objective
The objective of this task is to apply SOLID principles and design patterns to build a flexible,
maintainable, and extensible banking system.

## Description
This task focuses on designing a banking system that follows object-oriented design principles.
The system applies SOLID principles such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP),
Open/Closed Principle (OCP), and Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).

The system also uses design patterns including the Strategy Pattern to handle transactions
and the Facade Pattern to simplify interaction with the banking subsystem.
Automated test cases are used to validate system behavior.
