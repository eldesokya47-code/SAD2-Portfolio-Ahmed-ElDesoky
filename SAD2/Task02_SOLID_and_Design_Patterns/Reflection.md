# Reflection – Task 02

This task helped me understand how SOLID principles can be applied
to design real-world systems in a clean and structured way.

I learned how design patterns such as Strategy and Facade
improve system flexibility and maintainability.
Using automated tests increased my confidence in system correctness.

Overall, this task strengthened my understanding of system design
and object-oriented best practices.
