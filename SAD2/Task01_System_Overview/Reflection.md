# Reflection – Task 01

In this task, I learned how to analyze a system and identify its main components and actors. 
Creating the system overview helped me understand how different parts of the system interact with each other.

I also learned how to organize my work using GitHub repositories and markdown files. 
This task improved my understanding of system analysis and design concepts, especially system structure and functionality.

Overall, this task helped me develop both technical and analytical skills.
